## **1. Introduction**
The rise of quantum computing threatens classical cryptographic systems, particularly those used in **blockchain networks, secure messaging, and decentralized identity systems.** TetraCryptPQC proposes a **fully decentralized, post-quantum secure solution** that integrates **Web3 authentication, privacy-preserving identity verification, and quantum-resistant encryption.**

### **1.1 Problem Statement**
Current encryption and identity systems rely on classical cryptography, which is vulnerable to quantum attacks. **Shor‚Äôs algorithm** can break **RSA, ECDSA, and AES** with a sufficiently large quantum computer. Additionally, centralized identity and messaging systems are prone to surveillance, censorship, and data breaches.

### **1.2 Objectives**
1. **Replace classical cryptography with PQC algorithms (ML-KEM, SLH-DSA, Falcon, Dilithium)**.
2. **Enable decentralized identity (DID) and authentication using zk-SNARKs**.
3. **Ensure long-term quantum resilience through hybrid cryptographic approaches**.
4. **Decentralize data storage using IPFS and Filecoin**.
5. **Implement all cryptographic primitives in WebAssembly (WASM) for browser compatibility**.

## **2. Post-Quantum Cryptography (PQC) in Web3**

### **2.1 Cryptographic Algorithms**
**TetraCryptPQC integrates the following post-quantum secure algorithms:**

| Algorithm   | Purpose               | Security Level |
|------------|----------------------|----------------|
| ML-KEM     | Key Encapsulation Mechanism | 256-bit security (NIST FIPS 205) |
| SLH-DSA    | Stateless Hash-based Digital Signatures | 256-bit security (NIST FIPS 205) |
| Falcon     | Lattice-based Digital Signatures | 256-bit security |
| Dilithium  | Lattice-based Digital Signatures | 256-bit security |

### **2.2 Quantum-Secure Identity (Decentralized Identity - DID)**
Decentralized identity (DID) is implemented using **zk-SNARKs and Ethereum smart contracts**, allowing for:
- **Zero-knowledge authentication** (privacy-preserving identity verification).
- **Self-sovereign identity management** (no central authority).
- **Quantum-resistant signatures using Falcon/Dilithium.**

## **3. Decentralized Messaging Architecture**

### **3.1 Encryption & Authentication Workflow**
1. **User A and User B establish a secure session using ML-KEM (key exchange).**
2. **Messages are encrypted with AES-256-GCM (short-term security) and ML-KEM (long-term security).**
3. **Each message is signed using SLH-DSA, Falcon, or Dilithium.**
4. **Messages are stored on IPFS/Filecoin, with retrieval keys protected by zk-SNARKs.**
5. **User authentication is performed via Web3 decentralized identity (DID).**

### **3.2 Web3 Integration**
TetraCryptPQC connects to **Ethereum, zk-SNARKs, and IPFS** for:
- **On-chain identity verification.**
- **Decentralized key storage (Ethereum smart contracts + IPFS).**
- **zk-SNARK proof-of-identity without revealing private keys.**

## **4. Implementation (WebAssembly + Browser Compatibility)**

### **4.1 WebAssembly for Cryptographic Processing**
To ensure full **browser compatibility**, TetraCryptPQC uses **WebAssembly (WASM)** for cryptographic functions, providing:
- **Performance improvements (near-native execution speed).**
- **Memory safety & sandboxed execution (prevents side-channel attacks).**
- **Cross-platform deployment (browser + Node.js).**

### **4.2 Secure Storage with IPFS & Filecoin**
Messages and identities are stored in a **tamper-proof, decentralized format using IPFS & Filecoin**, preventing:
- **Censorship & data tampering.**
- **Centralized surveillance & data leaks.**

## **5. Security Analysis & Future Roadmap**

### **5.1 Quantum Resilience**
- **Hybrid cryptographic approach (PQC + classical encryption for transition period).**
- **Multiple signature schemes (SLH-DSA, Falcon, Dilithium) to mitigate specific algorithmic weaknesses.**

### **5.2 Future Roadmap**
- **Implementation of post-quantum secure smart contracts on Ethereum.**
- **Integration with Decentralized Autonomous Organizations (DAOs) for governance.**
- **Mobile app support for quantum-secure messaging.**

## **6. Conclusion**
TetraCryptPQC represents a **new standard for secure, decentralized communication in a post-quantum world**. By combining **PQC, Web3, zk-SNARKs, and IPFS**, it ensures:
- **Quantum-resistant identity & authentication.**
- **Fully decentralized, censorship-resistant communication.**
- **Seamless integration with Web3 ecosystems.**

This project lays the groundwork for the next evolution of **secure, trustless digital communication.**
