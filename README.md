# üõ°Ô∏è TetraCryptPQC: Quantum-Secure Web3 Messaging & Identity Framework

## üìä Project Overview
TetraCryptPQC is a comprehensive **post-quantum cryptography framework** designed for secure, future-proof messaging and identity verification. It implements NIST FIPS 205/206 compliant cryptographic algorithms to protect against both classical and quantum computing threats.

## üîê Key Security Features

- **Post-Quantum Cryptography**
  - ML-KEM-1024 (NIST FIPS 205) for key encapsulation
  - SLH-DSA (NIST FIPS 205) for digital signatures
  - Optional Falcon and Dilithium signature algorithms
  
- **Advanced Web3 Integration**
  - Decentralized Identifiers (DIDs) for self-sovereign identity
  - Zero-Knowledge Proofs for privacy-preserving verification
  - Decentralized reputation and trust systems
  
- **Enhanced Security Measures**
  - Homomorphic encryption for privacy-preserving computation
  - Hardware Security Module (HSM) simulation
  - Quantum Key Distribution (QKD) simulation
  - Perfect forward secrecy for all communications

## üîß Technology Stack

- **Frontend**: React, TypeScript, TailwindCSS
- **Cryptography**: NIST FIPS 205/206 compliant implementations
- **Messaging**: End-to-end encrypted communication protocols
- **Identity**: Web3 Decentralized Identity (DID) framework
- **Privacy**: Zero-knowledge proofs and homomorphic encryption

## üîç Real-World Applications

TetraCryptPQC is designed for implementation in:

- Financial services requiring long-term security
- Healthcare communications with strict privacy requirements
- Government and defense secure messaging systems
- Enterprise communications with forward security needs
- Web3 applications requiring quantum-resistant protection
- Personal privacy tools for the post-quantum era
